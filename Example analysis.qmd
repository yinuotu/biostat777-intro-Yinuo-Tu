# Part 1 Background and Problem Statement

- Dataset: The Gapminder dataset provides country-level data on key indicators such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population from 1952 to 2007. This data, originally sourced from [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), offers valuable insights into global health and economic trends.

- Question: "How have life expectancy and GDP per capita evolved over time, and what regional differences exist in these metrics?"

- Intended audience: Policymakers, economists, researchers, and anyone interested in global health and economic trends.

# Part 2 Data Wrangling

- Load necessary libraries

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(countrycode)

glimpse(gapminder, width = 50)
```


- 1. Filter data for specific years (2007)

```{r}
gapminder_1 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```

- 2. Create a new GDP column

gapminder_reshape <- gapminder_1 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(lifeExp, gdpPercap, pop), 
               names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")
head(gapminder_reshape)
```

- 5. Calculate mean life expectancy by continent for 2007

```{r message=FALSE}
gapminder_2007_by_continent <- gapminder_1 %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
gapminder_2007_by_continent
```

# Part 3 Data Visualization

## Plot 1-Life Expectancy Distribution by Continent (2007)

This boxplot shows the distribution of life expectancy for each continent in the year 2007. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR), with the line inside the box indicating the median life expectancy for each continent.


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_1, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink", "#7EEB03", "#FBE700", "lightblue", "#9F8AD4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Life Expectancy Distribution by Continent (2007)",
    subtitle = "Regional disparities in life expectancy",
    x = "Continent",
    y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
    caption = "Data Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),
    legend.position = "none" 
  )
```

::: {.callout-note}
Plot 1 shows that there are significant regional disparities in life expectancy, with Africa lagging behind other continents. These differences may be attributed to factors such as economic development, healthcare access, and infrastructure.

## Plot 2-Income and Life Expectancy Across Continents in 2007

This bubble plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across continents in the year 2007. Each bubble's size represents the population of the country, with color indicating the continent.


```{r warning=FALSE}
gapminder_2 <- gapminder_1 %>%
  mutate(

  )

gapminder_plot <- pp +
  annotate("text", x = 4000, y = 45, hjust = 0.5,
           size = 65, color = "#999999",
           label = "2007", alpha = .3) +
  annotate("text", x = 21000, y = 2, 
           label = "per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
           size = 2.6, color = "#999999") +
  theme(
    plot.margin = unit(rep(1, 4), "cm"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),

```

Here I use "world" dataset from ggplot2 to plot a worldmap.

```{r warning=FALSE}
world <- map_data("world") %>%
  filter(region != "Antarctica") %>%
  mutate(
    continent = countrycode(sourcevar = region, origin = "country.name", destination = "continent") %>%
      as.factor() %>%
      fct_relevel("Asia", "Americas", "Europe", "Africa", "Oceania")
  ) %>%
  drop_na(continent)

continent_map <- ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_map(
    map = world,
    aes(long, lat, group = group, map_id = region, fill = continent)
  ) +
  theme_map() +
  coord_map(xlim = c(-180, 180), ylim = c(-200, 200)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink", "#7EEB03", "#FBE700", "lightblue", "#9F8AD4")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = "#B8C2CC", fill = NA))

continent_map
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
gapminder_plot <- gapminder_plot +
  annotation_custom(
    grob = ggplotGrob(continent_map),
    xmin = log10(800),
    xmax = log10(650000),
    ymin = 5,
    ymax = 42
  )

gapminder_plot
```


::: {.callout-note}
Plot 2shows the relationship between economic prosperity and health outcomes, with wealthier countries tending to have higher life expectancies. Regional disparities are evident, with African countries generally having lower incomes and life expectancies, while European and some Asian countries perform better.

## Part 3-Life Expectancy Over Time by Continent

This line plot shows the trend in life expectancy over time from 1952 to 2007, faceted by continent. Each line represents a country.

```{r warning=TRUE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightpink", "#7EEB03", "#FBE700", "lightblue", "#9F8AD4"))+
  labs(
    title = "Life Expectancy Over Time by Continent",
    subtitle = "Significant improvements in Asia and Africa",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
    caption = "Data Source: Gapminder.org"
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~ continent)+
 theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```


::: {.callout-note}
Plot 3 shows that life expectancy has generally increased across all continents over time, while Asia and Africa have significant improvements, indicating global improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and economic conditions over time.

# Summary

In summary, this analysis of the Gapminder dataset reveals that higher GDP per capita is generally linked to longer life expectancy, as economic resources support better healthcare and living conditions. Significant regional disparities exist, with Africa having lower GDP and life expectancy, while Europe and Oceania lead in both metrics. From 1952 to 2007, life expectancy has increased globally, though at varying rates, with Africa and Asia showing slower progress. These findings emphasize global health and economic inequalities, underscoring the need for economic development to improve life expectancy in lower-income regions. This is consistent with findings by Miladinov (2020), who showed that higher GDP per capita and lower infant mortality are essential factors for increasing life expectancy in EU accession candidate countries, further supporting the link between socioeconomic development and longevity.


To verify the analysis, I compare the results from WHO.

![Life expectancy at birth (years) from WHO (2007)](who-2007.png) 

![Life expectancy at birth (years) from WHO (latest)](who-latest.png)


According to the results from WHO, the global average life expectancy has risen from 69 years in 2007 to 71 years in the latest data. This reflects improvements in healthcare, living conditions, and economic development worldwide.

Also, in both 2007 and the latest data, regional disparities are evident. Africa consistently shows the lowest regional life expectancy, indicating persistent challenges in healthcare access, economic resources, and disease burden.

These findings align with previous analyses, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts in low-income regions to bridge the life expectancy gap.

This analysis uses the Gapminder dataset [@gapminder] and references life expectancy data provided by WHO for 2007 and the latest available data [@who_life_expectancy_2007; @who_life_expectancy_latest]. It also draws on Miladinov's 2020 study on the relationship between socioeconomic development and life expectancy [@miladinov2020socioeconomic] to further support the findings.


## Requirements check:

1. Functions (At least five functions):

    - dplyr functions

        - `filter()`: to filter dataset for specific years (e.g., 2007)

        - `mutate()`: to create a new column for gdp (`gdp = pop * gdpPercap`)

        - `arrange()`: to sort data by gdp in descending order

        - `group_by()`: to group data by continent for aggregation

        - `summarize()`: to calculate mean life expectancy by continent

    - tidyr functions

        - `pivot_longer()`: to reshape data for analysis over time

    - ggplot2 functions

        - `geom_boxplot()`: to create a boxplot of life expectancy by continent

        - `geom_point()`: to create a bubble plot of gdp per capita vs life expectancy

        - `geom_smooth()`: to add trend lines to the bubble plot

        - `geom_line()`: to plot life expectancy trends over time by country

        - `facet_wrap()`: to create faceted plots for each continent

        - `scale_fill_manual()` and `scale_color_manual()`: to apply custom colors by continent

        - `labs()`: to add titles, subtitles, captions, and axis labels

        - `annotate()`: to add annotations (e.g., year "2007")


2. Three Plots Using Different geom_*() Functions:

    Plot 1: geom_boxplot()

    Plot 2: geom_point(), geom_smooth(), and geom_map()

    Plot 3: geom_line()

3. Faceting: Plot 2 uses facet_wrap(~ continent).

4. Margin content: next to the data dictionary, explaining the term GDP per capita.
